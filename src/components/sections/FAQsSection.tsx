            If my business joins the SIT STOP campaign do we have to provide a

              No - any chair in the part of your business that is open to the
              public is fine. Equally, if a chair is willingly provided on
              request, that is an acceptable alternative.

              Yes, we would be delighted to supply a <b>SIT STOP</b> sticker for
              the chair if you wish. Please do contact us to order your sticker.
              Details are on the contacts page.

              Yes, a chair which has a relatively high seat and ideally arms is
              the easiest for most people with mobility problems to use. However
              any stable chair is welcome to someone who needs to sit down.

              Any premises open to the public will from time to time have
              incidents of this type. Evidence from our pilot project is that
              participating in <b>SIT STOP</b> does not increase the frequency
              of such events. When they occur they should be addressed by staff
              in the way they have been trained.

              No, there is no incremental obligation beyond that which your

              We would be very pleased to know of public spirited businesses
              such as these! Displaying the <b>SIT STOP</b> logo helps the
              public, builds awareness of <b>SIT STOP</b> and assists
              recruitment of additional participant businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              By all means approach them to display the logo and put us in touch
              with them by giving us the name and address of the business and
              the name of the person you spoke to. Alternatively if you would
              like us to approach them just send us the details.
