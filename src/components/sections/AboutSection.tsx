          <b>SIT STOP</b> is an initiative that was started in 2006 by an
          independent community group in the London Borough of Richmond upon
          Thames. At <b>SIT STOP</b> our purpose is to make life just a little
          easier for those in need of somewhere to sit down.

          These individuals may be elderly, pregnant, disabled or unwell; they
          may have tired feet or be laden down with shopping or they may just
          need somewhere to wait for a few minutes. It does not matter what
          drives the need.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a shop or business displaying the <b>SIT STOP</b> logo, it is
          absolutely fine to ask for a seat or to use one if it is available. It
          is not necessary to be a customer of the store or to be using the
          services provided there.
        </p>
        <p>
          We continue to develop the <b>SIT STOP</b> campaign as we learn from
          our experience and listen to the input from supporting organisations.
